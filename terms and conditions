Welcome to Revival in Kenya. Revival in Kenya is  a group that was formed by Servants of God who came together after seeing the need to Bring the Church together, Raise Godly leaders and Godly altars and also to Bring Revival. Being well aware of the prophecies that Kenya is a spring board of Revival.
Matthew 19:27 Then Peter answered and said to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You. Therefore what shall we have?”

Mark 10: 29-30 Jesus said, "Mark my words, no one who sacrifices house, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, land--whatever--because of me and the Message will lose out. They'll get it all back, but multiplied many times in homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and land--but also in troubles. And then the bonus of eternal life!
